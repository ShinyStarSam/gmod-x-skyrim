# Gmod x Skyrim

Play Skyrim as a Garry's Mod player: Garry's Mod movement, weapons, health and HUD inside the real
Skyrim world. Both games run at the same time and talk through shared memory, the same approach as
[SkyCraft](https://github.com/chasmlol/SkyCraft). See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

> **Status: nothing works yet.** Phase 0 (linking the two games) is in progress.
> Single-player and offline only. Garry's Mod is always started with `-insecure` (VAC off).

## What works
